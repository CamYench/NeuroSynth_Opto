# NeuroSynth_Opto
This repository contains code for simulating a neural network with optogenetic stimulation using the NEURON simulation environment. The main script, OptoNeuralSim.py, models a network of 50 neurons with an input layer that is optogenetically stimulated using Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) mechanisms. This setup demonstrates the influence of optogenetic activation on network dynamics and enables the exploration of neuronal connectivity and response to light stimulation.
## Requirements
	•	NEURON simulator with Python support
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Matplotlib (for data visualization)
	•	Random (standard Python module)
